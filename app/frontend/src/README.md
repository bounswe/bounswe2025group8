# Neighborhood Assistance Board UI Implementation

This README describes the components implemented for the task detail and volunteer selection UI based on the provided designs.

## Components Implemented/Modified

### Pages:

1. `TaskPage.jsx` - Main task detail view page that uses TaskDetailComponent
2. `TaskListPage.jsx` - List of tasks displaying tasks with details
3. `HomeDashboard.jsx` - Homepage with featured and recent tasks
4. `SelectVolunteerPage.jsx` - Page for selecting volunteers for a task (already existed)
5. `RateReviewPage.jsx` - Page for rating and reviewing volunteers (already existed)

### Routes:

Routes have been added to App.jsx:

- `/` - HomeDashboard page
- `/tasks` - TaskListPage page
- `/tasks/:taskId` - TaskPage component showing task details
- `/tasks/:taskId/select-volunteer` - SelectVolunteerPage
- `/tasks/:taskId/rate-review` - RateReviewPage

### Integration with Existing Components:

- The implementation integrates with the existing `TaskDetailComponent`, `TaskDetailStates`, and other related components.
- The UI follows the Material UI design system as required.
- It uses task.jpeg as placeholder image from assets.

## Design Implementation Details

- The UI matches the design from the provided images:
  - Task detail page with a header showing task title, category, and urgency level
  - User info with avatar, name, and request time
  - Task details with time, location, people required, and contact information
  - "Waiting for Selecting" status as shown in the design
  - Select Volunteer button with proper styling
  - Edit and Delete buttons at the bottom

### Data Handling:

- The implementation uses mock data for initial display but is structured to fetch real data from the backend API when available.

## Next Steps:

1. Connect to real backend API endpoints
2. Implement API error handling
3. Add loading states for data fetching
4. Implement task creation functionality
